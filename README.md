# Digital Design with Verilog and System Verilog and Lab - ECE 526
## Student: Jose Martinez
### Professor: Dr. Orod

All labs for this class are located here. This repository is intended for potential employers to look at to verify knowledge of Digital Logic Design and Verification using Verilog.

#### Course Description:
This course covers the use of Verilog and SystemVerilog Languages (IEEE Std. 1800) for the design and development of digital integrated circuits, including mask-programmed integrated circuits (ASICs) and field programmable devices (FPGAs). Hierarchical top down vs. bottom up design, synthesizable vs. non-synthesizable code, design scalability and reuse, verification, hardware modeling, simulation system tasks, compiler directives and subroutines are all covered and illustrated with design examples.
